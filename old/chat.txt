By the way our contest quality have downgraded. I am very upset with ourselves.



We do not have enough problem bank. There is no one who review questions. No one gives a shit


i was feeling the same.




I think we should work more.


Actually I have putted a lot of effort for the contests. but it was not enough

If i wasn't busy with camp closing i woulld have looked for a problem to go at d, kb WAS askoing me to do that.




I know you do your job. But two people is not enough. The whole team should work. Since we have a lot of works.

tnant I have seen problem D was solved by 1 people and 3 people have tried it. so i decided to chose another and man betam bzu tyake felge new ahun yalewn D yagegnewt. 


But some of our team members doesn't even care. They said tewew zmbleh. BUt I do care about the students. Imagine the people who tried it and didnot solved it. But some of the heads does not give a f.



We should put more effort for the sake of our students. And also I do not like doing shit work. I need quality on my work. 


what do you think we should do? Maybe after camp. I hope so.

in the progress squad meetings, after jo joined of course, there is now a quota of at least 20 problems per topic, and there is a quota of at least 3 per person, and there is a meeting where each person explains the problem they chose and the approach they expect students to use, if not jo threatens to roast you
